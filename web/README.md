# openlim-web

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Start, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Start** - SSR framework with TanStack Router
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@openlim-web/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `bun run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

- Target: server
- Config: `docker-compose.yml` (app Dockerfiles live in `apps/*/Dockerfile`)
- Build images: bun run docker:build
- Start: bun run docker:up
- Logs: bun run docker:logs
- Stop: bun run docker:down

Environment variables are read from each app's `.env` file (baked into web builds for public variables) and overridden in `docker-compose.yml` for container networking.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying with Docker Compose](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/docker).

### Vercel Services

- Target: web
- Config: `vercel.json`
- Link the project first: bun run deploy:setup
- Local Vercel dev: bun run dev:vercel
- Sync preview env: bun run env:preview
- Sync production env: bun run env:production
- Dry-run check (no upload): bun run deploy:check
- Preview deploy: bun run deploy
- Production deploy: bun run deploy:prod
  Vercel Services share project environment variables, but deploys do not upload local `.env` files automatically. Link the project with `vercel link`, then run the env sync command before your first deploy (otherwise the deployment starts with no env vars), or pass one-off envs with `vercel deploy -e KEY=value`.
  Pass Vercel CLI flags to the env sync command directly, for example: `bun run env:production --scope your-team`.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying to Vercel](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/vercel).

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `bun run check`

## Better Auth Schema Generation

After changing auth plugins or schema options, run `bun run auth:generate` from the project root. The script runs the Better Auth CLI through `varlock run` from the owning app directory, loading the auth instance from `src/services.ts`. Review the schema changes, then use your ORM's migration workflow to apply them.
